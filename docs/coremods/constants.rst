Constants
=========

The ``constants`` module contains classes, functions, and attributes storing physical constants, as well as classes representing various cosmologies that are selectable as the sources for the physical constants.  The current default is the `WMAP7 cosmology <http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/dr4/parameters.cfm>`_.
